/**
 * Extension point: extra sidebar navigation items.
 *
 * Generated MVPs SHOULD write their primary section nav items here (e.g. "Workouts",
 * "Tournaments", "Recipes"). The template's `AppShell` merges them between the built-in
 * "Home" and "Settings" entries so the user-facing IA always reads:
 *
 *   Home → [your sections...] → Settings
 *
 * Conventions:
 *   - `href` MUST start with `/` and match an actual route in `src/app/(app)/`.
 *   - `href` MUST be a STATIC path. Hrefs containing `[bracket]` segments (e.g. `[id]`,
 *     `[slug]`) are FORBIDDEN — the sidebar renders on every page and has no dynamic id
 *     in scope, so a literal `[id]` href navigates to that path and 404s at runtime.
 *     `app-shell.tsx` silently drops any dynamic-href entry as a safety net. Link to
 *     dynamic routes from the parent detail page using a template literal instead.
 *   - `iconName` is one of the supported lucide-react icons (see ICON_MAP in app-shell.tsx).
 *     Omit to use the default folder icon.
 *   - 0–6 items recommended. The template's responsive nav is tuned for that range.
 *
 * To extend the sidebar, replace the array below with your items. Do NOT modify
 * `src/components/app/app-shell.tsx` — the merge logic is the stable contract.
 *
 * Example:
 *   export const extraSidebarNavItems: SidebarNavItem[] = [
 *     { href: "/home/workouts", label: "Workouts", iconName: "dumbbell" },
 *     { href: "/home/programs", label: "Programs", iconName: "calendar" },
 *   ];
